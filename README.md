# react-taskman

## Working Example

You may find a working example of this code at [https://4bv7um.csb.app/](https://4bv7um.csb.app/).

## Overview

This web site represents an initial foray into and demonstration of React skills. Both stateful and stateless React components are demonstrated, as well as how to build and style the interface for a simple SPA to-do list app.

## Usage

The app creates a task list based upon user input. The user may enter a task and push the 'Add' button, and it will be added to the "Tasks To Be Completed" list. The user has buttons to the right of each task on the "Tasks To Be Completed" list, to either delete the task or mark it completed. Marking a task completed removes it from the "Tasks To Be Completed" list and adds it to the "Completed Tasks" list. Buttons for each task on the "Completed Tasks" list can then be removed with the delete button.

This code may be installed and used in development mode with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/stoneneedle/react-tdl1.git
cd react-tdl
npm install
npm start
```

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes Boostrap, React and NodeJS to write the app. No database or backend server (other than the React test server) is used.

## Ideas for Future Improvement

The following ideas represent a possible trajectory for this project:

1. Login system: Users could login, saving the task lists they create.
1. Productivity Suite: Additional features such as deadlines and scheduling, as well as integration with Google/Microsoft Calendar.
1. Sidebar: Further implement a sidebar with a user profile, previous task lists, and a publishing system to make task lists public if desired, as well as the ability to view published task lists.

## User Stories

As a time-constrained office manager, I want to create task lists efficiently, so that I can see what has been accomplished and what remains to be accomplished.

As a busy site administrator, I want to log tasks that have been accomplished, so that I can budget my time more effectively.

As a working mother, I want to keep a grocery list, so that I can stop forgetting what to buy at the store.
